It is good there are a lot of trees, so you can leave your car in the shade. And the beach... I really enjoyed here, it is small beach and it is not overcrowded, that is important if you are visiting in the peak of the season. There is also small restaurant / caffe next to the coast, so you can order something. Water is clear and not polluted. Definitely reccommending this one to all of you!",

Car parking 4 euro / 6 euro for the day depending on which car park you choose (6 euro is ever so slightly closer) Lovely swimming with rocks for jumping/snorkelling. 12 euro per sunbed set. Good Value considering a few km north at Sveti Stefan itâ€™s at least 20 euro. Bar and restaurant. Toilets a bit basic. Would recommend and return .",

There is a well organized 3 car parks, the most lower is more expensive than 2 others but it worth if you stay all the day. On the beach there are parasols and sunbeds (13 Euro 1st row). There is a nice bar. Pura Vida, on the beach and restaurant Smokov Vijenac. We have been visiting this beach for more than 15 years and it is really one of the most beautiful site in Montenegro.`,
